# 🕵️‍♂️ Information Security, 💬 Social Engineering, and 🔓 Data Breaches

As someone who is interested in privacy and data security, I try to keep up on the topics and to be aware of the various threats that exist online and offline. This repo is to pull together some of the information I find myself repeating a lot and make it accessible to people in an easy format.

So first off,


## What is a data breach?

A data breach is when an attacker gains unauthorized access to information, such as personal, sensitive, or confidential information. Data breaches are all too common these days and companies seem to treat them as a cost of doing business.

## What happens to my data after a breach?

After a data breach, the sensitive information that has been obtained is typically sold, traded, used to pivot into another attack, leveraged, or released publically.

In some cases, the data obtained in a breach may be sold to **data brokers**, who then sell the information to other organizations, often for marketing purposes. These organizations may use the information for targeted advertising, sales leads, or to make other decisions about you.

In other cases, stalkers, abusive exes, and the like use it to find and harass their victims.

It's important to understand that once your personal information is available online, it's incredibly difficult to remove, and it can be used for malicious purposes for years to come.


## How do data breaches happen?

I like to categorize breaches into two broad types: Social & Tech. Social breaches directly exploit a human to gain access, whereas tech breaches exploit a bug or misconfiguration. The distinction can get a bit fuzzy, but it'll do for an overview.


### Social Engineering Attacks 🕵️‍♂️

Social engineering attacks are methods used by attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Here are a few of the more common types:

 > Phishing 🎣: A method of tricking individuals into revealing personal or sensitive information, often through fake emails or websites that appear to be from a legitimate source.
>
> Vishing 📞: A voice phishing attack, where the attacker calls and pretends to be from a legitimate organization to obtain sensitive information.
>
> Pretexting 💬: An attack where the attacker creates a false scenario or scenario that requires personal information from the victim.
>
> Watering Hole Attacks 🌐: A type of attack that involves compromising a website frequently visited by the target individual or organization.
>
> Baiting 💾: A physical attack where an attacker leaves a malicious device, such as a USB drive, in a public place with the hope that someone will pick it up and plug it into their computer.

⚠ One of the more interesting attacks I've seen in the past couple years was QR spoofing or replacing the QR code for the menu at a local cafe with a malicious one that directed the user's phone to an alternate site with an evil PDF version of the menu. Since COVID, we've become so used to scanning QR codes to check-in or view menus without making contact, that it's become a ligitimate means of targeting certain groups (like the pricey cafe across from Amazon's downtown buildings).

💡 Always be cautious of unexpected requests for personal information and to verify the authenticity of any communication before providing sensitive information.


#### A note on pressure tactics 💬

Scammers often use pressure tactics to try to get individuals to take immediate action. These focus on negative consequences if the victim does not comply with the request.

Some common forms of pressure are:

> Urgency 🏃‍♀️: Creating a sense of urgency, such as a deadline for payment or a service being disconnected.
>
> Authority 💂‍♂️: Pretending to be from a government agency, law enforcement, or company executive in order to scare the victim into complying with their request.
>
> Fear 😱: Threatening the victim with negative consequences, such as arrest or loss of personal information, if they do not comply with the request.
>
> Duty 🙇: "You are our last hope"
 
The goal of pressure tactics is to keep you from taking the time to think carefully and critically about the situation. If you are feeling pressured or scared by a request, take a step back and verify the authenticity of the communication before taking any action.


### Non-Social Engineering Attacks

## Data Breaches 🖳

A data breach is when an attacker gains unauthorized access to information, such as personal, sensitive, or confidential information. Data breaches are all too common these days, and companies seem to treat them as a cost of doing business. While there's not a lot most people can do about companies' data security practices, there's still quite a bit you can do to protect yourself.

>  * Use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts and use a password manager. 🔑
>  * Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts that offer it. 💻📱
>  * Keep your software and operating system up to date—this includes your browser. 🛠️
>  * Don't click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. ❌
>  * Regularly back up important data to an external hard drive or cloud storage. 💾
